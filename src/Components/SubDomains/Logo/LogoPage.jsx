							<h3>Why the hexagon?</h3>
							<p>
								Hexagon is nature{"â€™"}s most preferred shape.
								And if you are a Marvel fan, you do know the
								relevance of hexagons in the grandeur of the
								multiverse.
							</p>
							<p>
								We find hexagons in all kinds of places.
								Honeycomb, soap bubbles, cactus, hyperspeed
								portals in the Marvel multiverse. The hexagon is
								the strongest and the best-packed structure in
								all shapes.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our logo represents strength and uniformity. Our
								idea and the team behind it all is strong,
								stable and uniform just like the hexagon.

							<h3>The colors of our logo</h3>
							<p>
								Our logo ranges from blue to pink. The whole
								gradient represents our mainstream community
								platforms, the likes of Twitter, LinkedIn,
								Discord and Instagram.
							</p>
							<p>
								The gradient also represents that our community
								comes in all colors. We accept people of all
								genders and sexualities.
							</p>
							<p>
								And the logo also covers the fact that we accept
								people of all disciplines. Science, technology
								and the other fields, the likes of finance,
								philosophy, arts, et cetera.
